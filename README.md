- I’m interested in Python, Powershell, Algotrading (Cryptocurrencies in particular)

- I’m happy to collaborate on algotrading - Moving Averages, RSI, STOCH, STOCHRSI, MACD, and CCI are the primary indicators I work with in various combinations.  Currently working on Ichimoku Cloud trading strategy.
